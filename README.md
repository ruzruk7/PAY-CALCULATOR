# PAY-CALCULATOR
•Goal: Pay Calculator collects given hourly wage, bonuses, differentials and any other pay types along with any deductions such as taxes and Medicare provided by the user. The program will provide an approximate net pay for the given pay-period.  This alleviates the need to wait for the e-stub to know how much you made that pay-period, allowing for quicker budget/expenditure planning.

• Has in-build calculator mode. Originally was made as an independent project that was later merged into one.
